# Internal API

If you're a regular user, your reading can stop here. More advanced features are available under this section, but they
often require in-depth technical knowledge to use safely. The APIs here are a lower priority when it comes to breaking
changes and documentation, so you're more likely to end up somewhere confusing or broken.
