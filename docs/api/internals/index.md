# Internal API

If you're a regular user, your reading can stop here. More advanced features are available under this section, but they
often require in-depth technical knowledge to use safely. The APIs here are a lower priority when it comes to breaking
changes and documentation, so you're more likely to end up somewhere confusing or broken.

    I'm aware some of the documentation in the [DynamicWriter](./index.md) & [Datatypes API](./datatypes_api/index.md)
    is slightly confusing at the moment. It's something that'll be improved as time goes on.
