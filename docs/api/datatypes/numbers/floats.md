# Floating Points

Floats are numbers with potentially decimal values.
The number you see to the right of "f" indicates how many bits each [Datatype](../index.md) takes up.

| Name | Size    | Minimum Int    | Maximum Int   |
| ---: | :------ | -------------- | ------------- |
| f32  | 4 bytes | âˆ’16777216      | 16777216      |
| f64  | 8 bytes | -2^53          | 2^53          |

You can access each one with `light.datatypes.<Name>`.
