# Literals

Literals represent a value which is "literally" something.

Any value you pass to a literal will be decoded as a constant and cost zero bytes. Literals do not perform any
validation on inputs; instead, the value will be cast to the literal value on serialization[ยน](#validating).

## `#!luau function light.datatypes.literal`

```luau title='<!-- shared --> <!-- sync -->'
function literal<Value>(
    value: Value
): (Datatype<Value>)
```

## Validating

If you want to make sure the input equals the value the literal represents, you could use an
[Identifier Enum](./enums.md#identifier-enums)(1) with only a single item:
{.annotate}

```luau
local ty = light.datatypes

local literal = ty.literal(15)
local checked_literal = ty.enum({15})
