# Unknown

Unknown is a [Datatype](./index.md) that represents a value which should be serialized with the format Roblox's Remote
Events use. Using this while [sending unreliably](../network/messages/sending/send_unreliably.md) can cause issues
if the packet is too large.

## Instances

Consider using [Instance](./instance.md) if you need the value to be an instance.
